# Superforms CRUD

Demonstrating how to build a fully functional CRUD app with Superforms in about 150 lines of code.

**NOTE:** In svelte.config.js, `kit.csrf.checkOrigin` is set to `false` so forms can be posted on Stackblitz. If you're using this code somewhere else, remove this setting from svelte.config.js!
